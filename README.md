## 🚨 The Problem

AI has hit the gas pedal on development. New frameworks, tools, and projects drop daily.  
Keeping up? Nearly impossible.

The open-source landscape is exploding. By the time you've bookmarked a promising repo, three more have launched.

- Sales teams can't keep pace with product updates.  
- Support teams are left guessing.  
- Account executives are nodding along in demos — secretly lost.

Decide in minutes — not days — whether a project matters to you.

We're not here to replace your deep-dive tools — we help you decide **which projects deserve your attention** in the first place.

Paste any GitHub URL, ask questions in plain English, and get instant clarity.
