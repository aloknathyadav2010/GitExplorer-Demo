## 🚨 The Problem

AI has hit the gas pedal on development. New frameworks, tools, and projects drop daily.  
Keeping up? Nearly impossible.

The open-source landscape is exploding. By the time you've bookmarked a promising repo, three more have launched.

- Sales teams can't keep pace with product updates.  
- Support teams are left guessing.  
- Account executives are nodding along in demos — secretly lost.

## ✅ The Solution

**Git Explorer** lets you chat with any codebase *like it's a person.*

Ask questions.  
Get instant answers.  
Decide in minutes — not days — whether a project matters to you.

Quickly separate the **signal from the noise**. Understand what's worth your time before investing hours.

We're not here to replace your deep-dive tools — we help you decide **which projects deserve your attention** in the first place.

**Bottom line:**  
Stop drowning in GitHub stars. Start understanding what actually matters.  
Paste any GitHub URL, ask questions in plain English, and get instant clarity.

  - Single repo example:  
    `?repos=https://github.com/facebook/react`

    `?repos=https://github.com/facebook/react,https://github.com/vuejs/vue`

### Deploying Your Own Version  
To use the chat link for your own fork or app:

1. Deploy this project to a public URL (Vercel, Netlify, etc.).
